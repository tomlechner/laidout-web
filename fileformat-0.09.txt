#Laidout 0.09 File Formats

 # This file describes:
 #  1. Project files, which contain almost all of the possible Laidout elements
 #  2. a Laidout Image List file.
 # The laidoutrc file in ~/.laidout/(version)/laidoutrc documents itself.

 # Throughout this file format, data is grouped according to how much it is indented,
 # reminiscent of python, and the yaml file format. The format here is kind of a simplified
 # yaml. Here, there are basically a name and value (together called an attribute), plus any number
 # of subattributes. A value can be on the same line as the name, or it can span several lines.
 # If you write "thename \" on one line, then the next several lines that are more indented
 # than the name line contain the value. Always remember to use spaces for
 # indents. NEVER tabs, because they cause too much confusion. Comments begin with a '#'
 # character, and go until the end of the line. If you have a value that has such a character
 # in it, then simply put double quotes around the value. Finally, everything is case sensitive.


#----------------- Laidout Project files ------------------

 # The broadest file of a Laidout document is a Project file,
 # which contains 0 or more Document files, plus other resources.
 # For a project, the first line of the file will be (including the '#'):

#Laidout 0.09 Project

 # followed by all the project attributes. A stand alone Document file will start:

#Laidout 0.09 Document

 # followed by Document attributes. This pattern follows for most fragments of
 # Laidout elements, so for instance, a stand alone Laidout palette file will start:
 # "#Laidout 0.09 Palette" and will then continue with only palette attributes. Many resources, including
 # palettes, and window arrangements, can appear at the Project level or the Document level.

 # Without further ado, here are the actual elements, starting at the Project level:

#----------------- (starts on next line) ------------
#Laidout 0.09 Project
#You can specify any number of scratch spaces (limbo) that can be attached to views.
limbo IdOfLimbo
  object ... #each limbo is really just a Group of objects

#You can contain any number of text objects, maybe used elsewhere as scripts.
textobject name
  filename fname #the text can be in this file,
  text \ #or you can have the text right here
    ... 

#You can have any number of extra paper groups for special occasions.
papergroup "Name of paper group"
  (papergroup attributes)

# Documents can be included in the project file itself, or
# merely referenced, which is usually the more convenient way.
# If merely referenced, the line will look like:

Document blah.doc

#and the file, if relative pathname is given, is relative to the project file itself.
#Any other paths used by objects in the document, if they are within or under the
#project directory (the directory containing the project file), then the paths
#are written out as being relative to that project directory.

#If the document is embedded, it follows the normal Document format, as follows:

Document
  name   Some name for the doc  #any random name you care to give the document
  saveas /path/to/filename.doc  #The path previously saved as, which
                                #is currently ignored when reading in again.
  #A document has only 1 of the following impositions attached to it.
