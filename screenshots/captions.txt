# Initial comments can be used to define previous and next galleries:
#    #> nextgallery path/to/gallery
#    #> prevgallery path/to/gallery
# This will cause there to be links to path/to/gallery/img--first.html and
# path/to/gallery/img--last.html.
#
# To the left of the separator are the image file names relative to imagedir. 
# Next are formatting flags for the index thumb layout
# which can be - for insert break, or _=~ for bottom, middle,top
# Next is an optional thumbnail file relative to ./thumbs. 
# If it is not supplied, then the thumbnail is generated. 
# Next is a date field (YYYY M D H:M:S), such as for when the image was added.
# Finally is the alttext which should be plain text, as they are also the alt text.
# To add any comments to this file or to exclude any images from the slide 
# show, add a # sign at the beginning of their respective lines.  You may
# also change the order of images in your slide show at this time.
# You can define groups that are looped over with <!--LOOP GroupName--> by prefacing with a line:
#	 #> GroupName 
#	[#>grouptitle=Group Title, string of plain text
#	[#>groupdir=path/to/dir]
#	[#>grouptemplate=grouptemplatefile]
#	[#>groupbasename=sculptures]  <-- so group index dirs are named sculptures2.html for instance, numbers starting at 1
# The group name must be letters, no numbers, and the things in [] are optional (do not include the [] 
# To sum up: imagefile ---- formating ---- thumbfile ---- date ---- alttext

#... Here's another development update, showing how to use a layered color font, where each font file is a different colored layer 
#... in the final font. It's my hope to someday support opentype based color fonts, but this will have to do for now. Also new is
#... the ability to grab Fontmatrix font tags (if you have Fontmatrix installed), and use them to narrow a search for font.
#... <br><br>
#... Also demonstrated is the new Character Selection interface, which lets you insert any of the characters defined in
#... the font. This is only characters, not glyphs, so no access to opentype alternate styling yet, but I'm working on it.

monkeypatch.png ---- ---- ---- 2010 11 12 7:26:33 ---- Color patch gradients
#>smallcaption=(version 0.07)
#... The newly improved patch editing interface is getting to the point where it is actually a useful tool! At version 0.07, it's still
#... more or less at the proof of concept stage of development. In another couple of versions, it should get easier and easier to use.<br>
#... <br>
#... Version 0.07 saw major enhancements to the patch controls, but much work needs to be done still. The basic controls are 
#... as follows. Hovering over an outer
#... edge, then click and drag lets you drag that edge around. Shift-click-drag adds a new row or column off the side. Inside,
#... control-hover lets you select which inner edges you want to delete, and shift-control-hover shows where to subdivide a row
#... and/or column. Pressing 'j' (for jagged) toggles whether dragging vertex points will also drag the adjacent control points. 
#... Pressing 'd' will toggle between various ways to display control decorations. Finally, 'b' will toggle through various ways
#... to interpolate controls so that you don't have to.

#... dragging will let you resize the linear gradient, or change the start or end 
#... radius of a radial gradient. You can select and move the color
#... control points on screen, and change their colors by fiddling with the viewer's color box below. 


# epsshot.png ---- ---- ---- 2010 11 12 7:26:33 ---- EPS importing
# #>smallcaption=(version 0.06)
# #...Here we see how to fake having text and other exotic features, by importing EPS files generated by other programs.
# #...On the left is text imported from a page exported from <a href="http://www.scribus.net">Scribus</a>, 
# #...and on the right is a page of Bach's Partita 6 generated by the <a href="http://www.lilypond.org">Lilypond</a>
# #...music typesetting engine. These imported EPS files can then be repositioned to suit your fancy.
# #...Please note that when you import EPS into Laidout, you
# #...cannot manipulate the components of that EPS, only the EPS as a whole.<br>
# #... <br>
# #...Alternately, you can still export Laidout pages as EPS, then import them into, for instance, Scribus, after a fashion. There is no
# #...inherent way that I know of to import mass quanities of EPS files into
# #...Scribus, though I imagine it could be done in a script similar to 
# #... <a href="http://wiki.scribus.net/index.php/Automatic_import_of_images:_Versions_not_requiring_Tkinter">this one</a>, 
# #...When importing single EPS files to Scribus, remember to NOT
# #...use the File->Import->EPS! That seems to insist on breaking apart the EPS into its components, and can't deal with color patches, and
# #...I've noticed that objects that use masks, such as an ImagePatch object, seem to crash the import.  The way that does
# #...work in Scribus is to create an Image frame, and then right-click and "Get Image", which grabs the EPS as a whole, and 
# #...preserves the color patch gradients and warped images. 
# #...Then you can lay on text if you want, print out, and even make PDFs with patch gradients and warped images!



tatamishot.png ---- ---- ---- 2010 11 12 7:26:33 ---- Window arrangements
#>smallcaption=(version 0.05)
#... Here is a shot that shows various features of Laidout, including a splittable main window, shown as a tatami mat sort of layout.
#... You'll notice in the upper left that the whole view of the page is a bit rotated. In Laidout, you are not restricted to viewing pages 
#... as only portrait or landscape. 
#... Also in the upper left is the Object tool, which allows scaling, shearing, and rotating of multiple objects.
#... It has handles to drag around, as seen in Inkscape, but there is also what I call a three point transform, in which you can define the
#... center of scaling/rotation (control-left click), then click and drag any
#... other point, and the objects are scaled and rotated to match where you drag. Or you
#... can define the center, and also one other constant point (a second control-left click), then clicking and dragging a third arbitrary
#... point will shear the image to match where you drag this third point, with the first two points staying where they are.
#... <br/><br/>
#... Another feature seen in the lower right are definable page labels. The pages for this document are normally 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, but
#... here you see the custom i, ii, 1, 2, 3, and 4. This is two page ranges, one
#... with roman numerals, and the other with arabic numerals. The only drawback currently is that 
#... you have to enter the labels manually to a saved file. There isn't quite a
#... point and click way to add page ranges. That will probably come in 
#... version 0.092.



triacontahedron-0.03.1-2.png ---- ---- ---- 2010 11 12 7:26:33 ---- Nets
#>smallcaption=(version 0.03.1)
#... This is an example of a Net Imposition.
#... This particular net is a 30 sided Rhombic Triacontahedron layout, with a picture on 
#... each page. Each &quot;page&quot; is a kind of squashed square (rhombus). 
#... Also notice that each page clips the picture contained in the page. If you
#... look in the pagestyle element of each page in a saved document, you can include or delete 'pageclips' to
#... toggle whether or not a page will clip its contents. This also allows easy creation of centerfolds, for instance.
#... In that case, you might want your picture to span 2 pages, so you would not want 'pageclips' set on those pages.
#... Manipulating net impositions is very primitive in Laidout at the moment, but I have big plans in that direction, such as
#... being able to unfold something like this triacontahedron any way that it can be unfolded.
#... <br/><br/>
#... Cut this thing out, and you can fold it into
#... a spherical-ish polyhedron. As you can see, I mounted a camera inside one of these things so that I can photograph spherical
#... panoramas, such as this scenic staircase at the edge of the Portland, Oregon Rose Gardens.
#... The colors would match more but for my impatience with the partly cloudy sky that day.<br>


imagepach-0.02.1.png ---- ---- ---- 2010 11 12 7:26:33 ---- Image warping
#>smallcaption=(version 0.03)
#... You can distort images based on the same sort of bezier patch as the patch gradients above,
#... only using an image as the color source, rather
#... than a gradient. The current implementation of this feature still needs a bit of optimization, 
#... but it is enough to allow displaying and printing out the results. What it needs is
#... attention from someone who is actually skilled in low level rasterizing to speed it up a bit.



screenshot5.png ---- ---- ---- 2010 11 12 7:26:33 ---- Spread editor
#>smallcaption=(version 0.02)
#... This shot shows the splitable main window in action. It contains a 40-some page booklet on legal sized paper
#... that gets folded down the middle. The pane on the bottom is the spread editor, where you can swap pages, one with
#... another, or move a page to another spot so that the pages in between the old and new spots get shifted over. Also, 
#... you can drag a page up to a view window to set the view to that page. 
#... You will notice in this screen shot that a 'page' is half of a legal sized paper,
#... and you can rearrange the half-legal pages in the spread editor. 
#... You can also change how the page numbers are circled in the
#... spread editor, as a shorthand for how done you are with those pages.
#... When it prints, it will print out master pages on full legal sized paper:
#... 1 sheet with the last on the left and the first on the right, on the back of which goes a paper with
#... the second on the left and the next to last page on the right, and so on. Make double sided copies, fold and staple, and off you go!
